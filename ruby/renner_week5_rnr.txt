week 5 review and reflect

1. Data structures are perfect for storing information in indexes(sp) or key-value pairs

2. An array is a variable that contains data within an index.  Each element within an array is assigned a number (starting at 0) that is used to access the data

3. Days of the week or Items in a collection (books = [title, another title, etc])

4. A hash is a collection of a value and a key used to access/define it.  Hashes are great for forms that have a question that can be stored as a key and a user's input/answer that is stored as the key's value.

5. Playlist tracks and their songs. Food and their food group

6. Iteration is useful for accessing multiple elements in a data set with as few lines of code as possible

7. Chores.each do |enough, said|

8. A block is a set of code that can be called upon to process some data (like a method)

9. A block parameter is a place holder that allows for successive data to be input and processed.  The value comes from a variable that is passed into the parameter when the block is called.
