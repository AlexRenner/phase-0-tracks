# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows for the creation and editing of code and files without editing the original project.  This enables the ability for multiple people to work on many different aspects of a project simultaneously without fighting over the original code.  After finishing, developers can submit their alterations/additions for approval in tern limiting the insertion of broken code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master (original project) used by a developer so he/she can test, edit or add to the project without altering the master until the code is completed and approved.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

After making changes to a branch they must be committed before they may be merged back into the master branch.  A commit is the action taken within the command line that does this.  A commit message must be added and should contain a specific and detailed message that describes what was updated or added.  Commits can later be accessed as if a 'save spot' in case a developer needs to backtrack to prior code.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when there are two or more incompatible elements between the current branch and the branch you are trying to merge it with.
